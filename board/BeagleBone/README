BeagleBone is supported by FreeBSD-CURRENT since
August, 2012.

============================================================

What is a BeagleBone?
--------------------

The BeagleBone is an ARM-based development/test board from the
BeagleBoard project.  It features a modern ARMv7 processor and a
wealth of on-chip peripheral support.  Details can be found at:

   http://beagleboard.org/bone

The BeagleBone is an easy way to learn about ARM development: it is
inexpensive (about $85) and does not require any special skills or
hardware to use.  You connect it to your desktop with a Mini USB cable
(which both powers the board and provides serial console access) and
boot it from a MicroSDHC card with the system image.

Once you have the BeagleBone working, you can expand it by connecting
it to Ethernet, adding USB peripherals (such as external disk drives
or wireless network interfaces) or attaching new hardware to the
connectors on the board.

============================================================

How to boot the BeagleBone
--------------------------

1. CONNECT the board to your FreeBSD system using a Mini-USB cable.
   The Mini-USB connector is on the bottom of the BeagleBone.

2. ACCESS the serial console on the board from your desktop:
   $ sudo cu -l /dev/ttyU1 -s 115200

   (You may need to load the uftdi driver into your kernel.)

3. INSERT the MicroSDHC card into your BeagleBone

4. REBOOT the BeagleBone by depressing the small
   switch next to the Ethernet port.

============================================================

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------

If the image fails to boot:
  * Look at the build and install logs under the 'work' directory.
  * Ask on the arm@freebsd.org or freebsd-current@freebsd.org mailing list for
help.

Anatomy of a BeagleBone Boot Image
----------------------------------

The FreeBSD bootable image for BeagleBone has both FAT
and UFS partitions containing the following files:

  FAT Partition
     MLO  - First stage boot, from U-Boot
     u-boot.img - Second stage: U-Boot
     uEnv.txt - configuration for U-Boot
     ubldr - Third stage: FreeBSD bootloader

  UFS Partition
     /boot/kernel - dynamic kernel
     ... rest of FreeBSD ...

The boot process works like this:

 1) AM3358 SoC ROM code inspects the MicroSDHC card, finds the MBR
    partition table and loads "MLO" from the first FAT partition.

    MLO is loaded before external RAM is initialized, so it has to be
    under 110k to fit within the on-chip RAM.  MLO here is a
    stripped-down version of U-Boot.

 2) MLO loads u-boot.img from the first FAT partition.

    U-Boot is a highly modular boot loader system that can be used on
    a wide variety of systems.  The loader is configured with built-in
    script commands that can be partially overridden by additional
    commands in the uEnv.txt file.

 3) U-Boot loads uEnv.txt and follows those commands to load ubldr at
    address 0x88000000.

    ubldr is a variant of FreeBSD's standard loader(8) program that is
    designed to be chain-loaded from U-Boot.  It calls into U-Boot for
    low-level device access, which allows ubldr to load FreeBSD on any
    system that supports U-Boot.

 4) ubldr locates the UFS partition, loads /boot/kernel/kernel from
    UFS to address 0x80200000 and executes it.

============================================================

NATIVE SOURCE REBUILDS
---------------------------------------

One of my goals is for the usual "make buildworld",
"make installworld", "make buildkernel", and
"make installkernel" to all work natively on the BeagleBone.
A few people have had success, though a buildworld
seems to take more than 30 hours.

 $ make buildworld
 $ make installworld
 $ make KERNCONF=BEAGLEBONE buildkernel
 $ make KERNCONF=BEAGLEBONE installkernel

If you want to try this, you'll want an 8G image.
You can put the source tree into the image when
you build it by including the following in your
config.sh:

  customize_freebsd_partition ( ) {
     freebsd_install_usr_src
     disk_add_swap_file 768
  }

After you boot the resulting image, you'll have a fully
populated /usr/src and can try rebuilding the system
natively.

Alternatively, of course, you can use "portsnap" to
download and install a ports tree, build the subversion
port, and checkout the FreeBSD source code using that.
This works, I've done it.

PROJECTS
-----------------------------------------

If you're interested, there are a lot of things still to
be done:

 * Use the system.  The stability has been generally improving
   but the more people use and stress it, the more issues we'll
   be able to shake out.  Report any problems on freebsd-arm
   mailing list.
 * Test ports.  I've tried building a few ports natively with
   somewhat mixed success.  Try things and let us know what
   you find.
 * USB.  Oleksandr has a patchset floating around but it's
   incomplete.  Ask if you're interested.
 * GPIO.  Some initial GPIO work is done but there are
   evolving ideas about how to make the GPIO framework
   more robust.
 * Other drivers.  The AM3358 SoC has a lot of hardware
   components that are still unsupported.
 * Refining the system configuration:  A machine with only
   256MB RAM probably should not have sendmail, syslog, and
   other daemons started by default.
 * Memory.  Some recent change reduced available memory quite
   a bit.  Easy fix is to turn off things in rc.conf.
   There are probably also kernel tweaks possible.
 * USB client.  The Linux distros have a virtual Ethernet
   client that allows true single-cable development.  I would
   like to do something similar for FreeBSD.
