The AutoSize option adds a startup command that will attempt to use
growfs to enlarge the FreeBSD partition.

This allows you to create and distribute a relatively small image that
will automatically expand to fill whatever media it is installed on.

For example, you could create a 1GB image that would fit on a 1GB card
but could also be copied onto a 32GB card.  In the latter case, the
filesystem would be automatically expanded on the first boot to fill
the card.
