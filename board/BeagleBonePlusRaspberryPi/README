N.B.: This is broken since I rearchitected crochet
to use the strategy list approach.  Needs to be overhauled.

This was a *VERY* experimental ongoing project to build a
FreeBSD/arm system image that can boot on more than one
system.

In this case, the two systems I'm targeting are BeagleBone
and RaspberryPi.

This board definition successfully installs a full set of
boot bits for both boards:  The result can load a FreeBSD
kernel on either system and present that kernel with the
correct machine-specific FDT data.

Unfortunately, there is not yet a single FreeBSD kernel that
can actually run on either system, although several people
are actively working on it.  There are a number of issues
that need to be addressed before this is possible; please
ask on the freebsd-arm mailing list if you have questions
or would like to help with this effort.
