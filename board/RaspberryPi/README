RaspberryPi is supported by FreeBSD-CURRENT as
of November, 2012.

========================================================================

What is RaspberryPi?
--------------------

RaspberryPi launched in early 2012 as an inexpensive ($35) PC
based on a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC.   It was developed by the
UK-based RaspberryPi foundation as an inexpensive system for
educational use.

Having been designed as a PC (rather than as a development/experimenter
board), it has a slightly different focus than some similar
systems:
 * Emphasis on low cost.
 * Built-in video (HDMI and composite)
 * Relies on standard consumer accessories:  can be powered from
   a common micro-USB charger, uses USB keyboard, consumer television
   display, etc.

The RaspberryPi has been wildly successful (hundreds of thousands
of units sold) and has attracted a large following.

How to Boot the RaspberryPi
---------------------------

As of 1 November 2012, FreeBSD-CURRENT does not fully support the
native console, so you'll probably want a serial adapter cable.
Adafruit.com sells one especially designed to work with RaspberryPi
which can also provide power to the board.

After connecting video, keyboard, and inserting the SDHC card,
you connect power (either by attaching the last lead of the serial
cable or connecting a micro-USB charger) to actually boot.

============================================================

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------

If the image fails to boot:
  * Look at the build and install logs under the 'work' directory.
  * Ask on the arm@freebsd.org or freebsd-current@freebsd.org mailing list for
help.

Anatomy of a RaspberryPi Boot Image
----------------------------------

The FreeBSD bootable image for RaspberryPi has both FAT
and UFS partitions containing the following files:

  FAT Partition
     bootcode.bin - First stage boot
     start.elf - Second stage boot
     config.txt - configuration for start.elf
     ubldr - Third stage: FreeBSD bootloader

  UFS Partition
     /boot/kernel - dynamic kernel
     ... rest of FreeBSD ...

More details on RaspberryPi boot sequence can
be found in the README file in the "boot"
directory.

(Note that the "Phase One" RaspberryPi boot
process is still evolving.)

Note:  I suspect there may be merit in having
start.elf load the FreeBSD kernel directly, bypassing
ubldr.  There are some issues still to be resolved
before this is feasible.

PROJECTS
----------------------------------------

There is still a lot of work to be done.
Ask on freebsd-arm@freebsd.org mailing list if you
would like to help.
