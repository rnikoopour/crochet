# PROVIDE: autosize

# KEYWORD: firstbootonly

# Automatically grow mmcsd0s2a to fill the
# entire SD card.
#
# This allows us to distribute a single image
# and have it work on essentially any size SD card.
#
# TODO: Make this more generic; it currently has
# the partition name(s) hardcoded.
#
# TODO: Figure out a clean way to have this run
# only on first boot.  (We can't write anything to
# disk here since the root disk is still mounted
# read-only at this point.)  Fortunately, it completes
# very quickly if it can't actually grow the partition.
#
# TODO: Figure out where this should really be ordered.
# I suspect it should go just after fsck but before mountcritlocal
# but it's hard to tell for sure because of the bug described
# below.
